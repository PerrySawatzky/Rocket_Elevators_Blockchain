## General
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate Smart Contracts deployed through a React app. We worked on Tokens (ERC20's) and Non Fungible Tokens (ERC721's).

## Technologies
* Solidity
* React
* MetaMask
* Infura
* OpenZeppelin
* Ganache
* Truffle 

## Setup
To complete a Smart Contract, you must create an account with MetaMask and activate the extension in Chome or Firefox.

To ensure the metamask extension is connected to the site, open the extension and verify. If you see 'Not Connected' click on Account Options(Three dots on the right) then "Manually connect to current site". Select Ropsten Test Network from the dropdown.

Fill in your order and hit submit.

If cloning this project:

Open Ganache and select Quick Start Ethereum.
In the terminal enter '''npm start '''
Once your localhost has opened, click your MetaMask and select Ganache from the network dropdown.

Fill in your order and hit submit.
